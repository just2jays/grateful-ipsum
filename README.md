## API

This project doesn't rely on any "live" or dynamic API calls. Instead, all of the generated text simply relies on a
dictionary of content.

The dictionary is located at `/config/dictionary.js` and is simply an array of Dead related terms!

So while the code itself is ridiculously simple, the dictionary can be updated to include new terms and phrases that are 
culturally related to the Dead and the jamband scene they created.

Please feel free to submit pull requests with updated terminology to the dictionary which will be included in the generated text by everyone!

## Styles

This project takes extensive advantage of the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) styling utils.

Please see the documentation there for a better understanding of how it works before jumping into this project!
